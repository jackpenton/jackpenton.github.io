<h3> PRISON MAIL </h3>

 <h4><u> Synopsis</u></h4>
 
 <p>Prison mail is based on sending and recieving mail from inmates around
  the world. Using a pen and paper, the aim is to tap into criminal minds and provide
  a unique perspective of life in prison. </p>
 
 <p>The first step is to create a rough draft of the letter that is going to be sent.
  This should be clear, concise and short in length to convey the right information. The 
  sole purpose behind the letter is to initate contact.
 </p>
 
 <p>Next, you need to establish who to contact. There are a number of websites which
  provide the details of prison convicts. These profiles contain a small personal
  bio and details about the conviction. 
 </p>
 
 <p>To ensure that personal details and identity are not compromised, it is important
  that you create an anonymous letter box. This is designed to keep your home address
  private and is considerably cheaper then a PO Box.</p>

  <p>Send several test letters to the surrogate address and check the letterbox. Once a 
  secure connection has been established, you can begin to send letters to the 
   recipient.</p>
