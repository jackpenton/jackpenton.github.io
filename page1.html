<h3> PRISON MAIL </h3>

 <p>Prison mail is based on sending and recieving mail from inmates around
  the world. Using a pen and paper, the aim is to tap into criminal minds and provide
  a unique perspective of life in prison. </p>
 
 <p>The first step is to create a rough draft of the letter that is going to be sent.
  This should be clear, concise and short in length to convey the right information. The 
  sole purpose behind the letter is to initate contact.
 </p>
 
 <p>Next you need to establish who to contact. There are a number of websites which
  provide the details of prison convicts. </p>
